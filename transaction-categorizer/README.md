Run `categorizer.py` for an interactive dialog for creating categories for different transactions on a CSV-formatted bank statement. Categories are given names and distinguished by regular expressions applied to the description for a given transaction. Column order is expected to be `date,description,amount`. Names and regexes are saved to `category_mapping.json`. The output is `output.txt`, a column which matches the row order in the input csv, `2021_merged.csv`.
